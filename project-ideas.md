# Project Ideas

- Choose a cybersecurity problem, build a dataset, and show/explain its implications

- Use current gaps in cybersecurity research to build a “useful” dataset and analyze it

- Enhance/create an implementation and apply it to an exisiting cybersecurity problem

- Use libraries like sklearn, tensorflow, or pytorch to build a simple maching learning model for a cybersecurity problem

- Use a different machine learning library or algorithm and apply it to one of the cybersecurity problems we looked at in lecture

- Use an existing dataset and apply a technique used in class; in addition, add enhancements and explore different parameter values

- Use APIs to mine data on open-source projects over time to evaluate bug trends

- Reproducing models and analyzing results from a previous cybersecurity data-driven research paper
