# Project Ideas

- Choose a cybersecurity problem, build a dataset, and show/explain its implications

- Use current gaps in cybersecurity research to build a “useful” dataset

- Enhance/innovate an implementation to an exisiting cybersecurity problem/solution

- Use libraries like Tensorflow or Pytorch to build a simple maching learning model for a cybersecurity problem

- Use an existing dataset and apply a technique used in class; in addition, add enhancements and explore different parameter values

- Use APIs to mine data on open-source projects over time to evaluate bug trends
