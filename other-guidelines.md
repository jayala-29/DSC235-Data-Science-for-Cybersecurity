## Additional Exercises (20% of overall grade)

In most weeks, there will be supplemental additional exercises that will allow you to further expand upon what we discussed during lecture
and provide different approaches that can be applied in your projects. These are not meant to be difficult or time-consuming as we will be
scratching the surface of cybersecurity + data science topics given that this is a 1-unit course. In addition, the additional exercises are
in the form of Jupyter Notebooks and are credit-based (not correctness-based) to encourage you to treat them as project/Python supplements.
Each of these assignments is worth 3%, your grade for this section will be calculated as `min{submitted_assignments,20}`
