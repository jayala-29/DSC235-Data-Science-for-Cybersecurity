# Other Guidelines

## Additional Exercises (~21% of overall grade)

In most weeks, there will be supplemental additional exercises that will allow you to further expand upon what we discussed during lecture
and provide different approaches that can be applied in your projects. These are not meant to be difficult or time-consuming as we will be
scratching the surface of cybersecurity + data science topics given that this is a 1-unit course. In addition, the additional exercises are
in the form of Jupyter Notebooks and are credit/effort-based (not correctness-based) to encourage you to treat them as project/Python supplements.
Each of these assignments is worth 3%.

## Discussion Boards (~18% of overall grade)

For this portion of the grade, you will (1) respond to the prompt using at least 50 words and (2) respond to someone else's post in a way that is elaborate or adds to a potential follow-up discssion (e.g. I like the way you stated... I think... Have you considered...).

## Peer Review (10% of overall grade)

For this portion of the grade, you will be required to give feedback on 2-3 others' project milestones/submissions depending on the amount of groups there are.
