# DSC-495-602: Data Science for Cybersecurity (Fall 2022)

## Motivation

In 2021 alone, a cyber attack occurred once every 39 seconds on average. Data Science for Cybersecurity will introduce students to the use of data to discover, explore, and address relevant cybersecurity use cases. Students will become familiar with fundamental approaches to tackle common cybersecurity problems using Python in this introductory-level course.
