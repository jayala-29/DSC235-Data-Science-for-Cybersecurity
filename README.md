# DSC-495-602: Data Science for Cybersecurity (DRAFT)

## Motivation

In 2021 alone, a cyber attack occurred once every 39 seconds on average. Data Science for Cybersecurity will introduce students to the use of data to discover, explore, and address relevant cybersecurity use cases. Students will become familiar with fundamental approaches to tackle common cybersecurity problems using Python in this introductory-level course.

## Academic Integrity

The course will follow all NCSU academic [integrity regulations](https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/academic-integrity-overview/). All students are expected to maintain traditional standards of academic integrity by giving proper credit for all work. All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued. A student shall be guilty of a violation of academic integrity if he or she represents the work of others as his or her own or aid another’s misrepresentation.

We encourage you to read the ACM Code of Ethics, particularly Sections 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 2.2 and 2.4: https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics

## Equity Policy

All persons, regardless of age, race, religion, gender, physical disability or sexual orientation shall have equal opportunity without harassment in this course. Any harassment should be reported immediately to the instructor.

Students are responsible for reviewing the NC State University PRR’s which pertains to their course rights and responsibilities:

## Students with Disabilities
The course will follow all NCSU regulations relevant to students with disabilities. Any students requiring additional assistance due to disabilities (e.g., learning disabilities), should contact the instructor during the first week of the semester. Students requiring extra time for examinations and quizzes are asked to make arrangements at least three days in advance. You may contact the NCSU Disability Services for Students Office regarding campus services at the Student Health Center for more information and assistance: http://www.ncsu.edu/dso/students
