# Project Guidelines

## Due Week 8 in-lecture (Problem Statement - 5%)

This week, you will have a problem statement due. In your problem statement, you will address:

1. What cybersecurity-oriented topic do you think you want to address in your project?
2. Do you think you'll have to create a dataset? Or are there some/one that exist/you already found? If so, reference them.
3. Is there a specific relationship you are looking for? 

## Takes place Week 15 in-lecture (Presentation - 10%)

This week, you will present your problem to your peers (3-5 minutes). In your presentation, you will address:

1. What topic you are addressing in your project? Why is it interesting to you?
2. A description of your dataset, regardless if it already exists or you created it yourself.
3. How you plan to analyze your data. Did you filter any data? Did you use a ML algorithm? Did you modify/create an algorithm? Etc.
4. Any obstacles you've overcome/forsee before submitting your project.
5. Additional Q&A if time permits.

## Due December 12, 11:59 PM PST (Deliverable - 45%)

The following should be addressed in a Jupyter notebook including samples of the dataset, reproducible models, visuals shown/rendered, etc. similar to
what is shown in lecture and the at-home exercises:

1. Finalized Problem Statement [5 points]
2. Dataset [10 points]
- Is there an existing dataset? [5 points] 
    - If so, how is it useful for your problem? 
        - Can anything be removed? Why?
    - If not, how will you create one?
        - What did you add? Why?
- Explain each “useful” component of your dataset [5 points]
3. Analysis [15 points]
- How can we analyze the data? [10 points]
    - Are we using a machine learning model?
        - Which one? why?
    - Are we using a handcrafted algorithm?
        - What parts did you create/modify? references?
- Explain your approach and how the “innards” work [5 points]
    - Provide and simplify any references made
    - Explain why you chose this approach
4. Visualization [10 points]
- How can the results be visualized? [5 points]
- How can the visual help us address the problem? does it reflect what we expected? [5 points]
5. Insights [5 points]
- What are three insights gained from the results? [3 points]
- Did everything go as expected? explain [2 points]
