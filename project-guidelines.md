# Project Guidelines

## Due Week 8 (Checkpoint 1 - 5%)

This week, you will have a problem statement due. In the linked ([Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p4p6RNCNMB-S2uAUwYGq6zbZbgtlO0XtSsGb0kmQSXY/edit?usp=sharing)) - make sure you are signed in with your NCSU email, you will address:

1. Group: Who is in your group? (1-3 people)
2. Topic: What cybersecurity-oriented topic do you think you want to address in your project?
3. Relevance: Why is this problem interesting to you?
4. Dataset: Do you think you'll have to create a dataset? Or are there some/one you already found and plan to use? If so, reference them.
5. Prediction: Is there a specific relationship you are looking for? 

## Due Week 13 (Checkpoint 2 - 5%)

This week, you will have a progress check-in due. In the linked Google doc (TBD), you will address:

1. Update: What cybersecurity-oriented topic are you going to address in your project?
2. Progress: What have you accomplished so far? What do you have left to do?
3. Schedule: Are you on track to complete what you proposed?
4. Obstacles: Have you encountered any surprises or unexpected problems?
5. Workarounds: If you’re having problems, how do you intend to solve them or work around them?

## Due Week 15 (Presentation - 15%)

This week, you will present your problem to your peers (3-5 minutes). In your presentation, you will address:

1. What topic you are addressing in your project? Why is it interesting to you?
2. A description of your dataset, regardless if it already exists or you created it yourself.
3. How you plan to analyze your data. Did you filter any data? Did you use a ML algorithm? Did you modify/create an algorithm? Etc.
4. Any obstacles you've overcome/forsee before submitting your project.

## Due December 12, 11:59 PM PST (Deliverable - 25%)

The following should be addressed in a Jupyter notebook including samples of the dataset, reproducible models, visuals shown/rendered, etc. similar to
what is shown in lecture and the additional exercises (breakdown of 50 possible points):

1. Finalized Problem Statement [5 points]
- Topic, relevance, and initial prediction
2. Dataset [15 points]
- Is there an existing dataset? [5 points] 
    - If so, how is it useful for your problem? 
        - Can anything be removed? Why?
    - If not, how will you create one?
        - What did you add? Why?
- Explain each “useful” component of your dataset (which/how do the column headers contribute to your problem?) [10 points]
3. Analysis [15 points]
- How can we analyze the data? [10 points]
    - Are you using a machine learning model?
        - Which one? Why?
    - Are you using a handcrafted algorithm?
        - What parts did you create/modify? References?
- Explain your approach and how the “innards” work [5 points]
    - Provide any references you used 
    - Explain why you chose this approach
4. Visualization [10 points]
- How can the results be visualized? [5 points]
    - Confusion matrix? Plots? Etc.
- How can the visual help us address the problem? Does it reflect what you expected? [5 points]
    - Clear relationship shown? No relationship shown? Accurate predictions by the model? Etc.
5. Insights [5 points]
- What are three insights gained from the results? [3 points]
- Did everything go as expected? Explain [2 points]
